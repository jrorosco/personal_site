    abstract = {We describe a physical framework for analyzing the spectral dynamics of a broad range of media. The framework is built on a variable order calculus formalism that permits the description of temporally nonlocal behavior. Such emergent behavior is observed in the response of assorted complex media. The analytical features of the formalism are discussed and it is demonstrated how they correspond to the generalization of other well known theories for the description of nonlocal many-body effects. The framework is employed to analyze a set of spectroscopic data for the high frequency dielectric response of a nanofluidic graphene dispersion and the mid-infrared optical response of amorphous quartz silica. A practical application of the analysis is facilitated by a novel model definition that generalizes the semi-classical Lorentz theory to allow for nonlocal damping effects. The model is derived from a fractional order differential equation of motion. From the analysis, an estimated parameterization for the novel model structure is obtained. The fidelity of the analysis methodology is validated against optimized parameterizations in a multi-objective (optical and radiative) setting. The results demonstrate the utility of the analysis and indicate a specific well-defined region of nonlocality having a distinct fidelity that encompasses the entire Pareto front. This region is shown to be inaccessible to integer order descriptions of the mean field dynamics.}
