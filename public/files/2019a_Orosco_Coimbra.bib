  abstract = {We derive a thermophysical model for the infrared radiative response of common metals by modifying a recently proposed model to account for the presence of thermally driven dynamics. The temperature-dependence of our model is built upon the consistency of the equation of motion with the predictions of the relevant equilibrium theory for temperature-dependent carrier transport. The model parameters are systematically regressed over data representing a range of temperatures. The resulting model is valid over the approximate spectral range $\lambda\in[1,16]\,\mu$m and for the approximate temperature range $T\in[300,700]\,$K. Since the model is expressed as a complex-valued frequency response function, it can be directly incorporated into the Fresnel relations for use with more general optical and radiative frameworks.}
