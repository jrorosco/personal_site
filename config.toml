		content = "I'm a Ph.D. student in the [department of mechanical and aerospace engineering](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I am advised by [Carlos Coimbra](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=324) and funded by the [San Diego Fellowship](https://grad.ucsd.edu/financial/fellowships/entering-students/sd-fellowship.html). I love all things science, but I'm especially interested in problem solving with the use of math, physics, and a hard-earned intuition about physical systems. I have a B.S. (2014) and an M.S. (2016) in mechanical engineering, both from UC San Diego. <br><br> I joined the [Coimbra Research Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/) (CRG) during my junior year of undergraduate study in 2012, and since then I have been involved with a number of research projects such as resource to power modeling for large-scale solar power plants and the development of low cost, rapidly deployable, self-sustaining [portable weather sensing stations](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNpTO-wg1ZiwnDZPU1G_ZM6gj0-huyLOT3A2zw23cqiHEN935GVEvDb94tqdPFl2Q?key=anBRQm9pblp3dVBNMGl6SVZpWWh3LUs2VjZfUDN3). Sometimes, I build robots [[1](https://youtu.be/HZC7KEO-Fjc?t=46), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT6fh77XeX8), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z70l3OUy9N4)]. Over the Summer and Fall of 2016, I spent time working on cutting edge semiconductor chip manufacturing technology at [Cymer/ASML](https://www.cymer.com/).<br><br> Outside of research, I occasionally mentor undergraduate students on their journey toward postgraduate study through the [STARS](https://grad.ucsd.edu/degrees/summer-researches/stars/index.html) and [UC LEADS](http://grad.ucsd.edu/degrees/summer-researches/uc-leads/program-objectives.html) programs. In the past I have also worked with the [IDEA Scholars](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/scholars.shtml) program and with high school outreach through the CRG."
