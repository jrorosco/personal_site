		content = "I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar studying acoustic microfluidics in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at [University of California San Diego](http://ucsd.edu). I received my BS (2014), MS (2016), and PhD (2019) from UCSD. My dissertation research was advised by [Carlos Coimbra](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=324), and was funded by the [San Diego Fellowship](https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/incoming-fellowships/sdf-cr-fellowships.html) and the [President's Dissertation Year Fellowship](https://grad.ucsd.edu/financial/fellowships/funding-opportunties/presidents-dissertation-year-fellowship-fletcher-jones.html). During my time with the [Coimbra Research Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/) (CRG) I was involved with a number of research projects such as resource-to-power modeling and high-fidelity forecast generation for large-scale solar power plants, and the development of low-cost, rapidly deployable, self-sustaining [portable weather sensing stations](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNpTO-wg1ZiwnDZPU1G_ZM6gj0-huyLOT3A2zw23cqiHEN935GVEvDb94tqdPFl2Q?key=anBRQm9pblp3dVBNMGl6SVZpWWh3LUs2VjZfUDN3). Sometimes I build robots [[1](https://youtu.be/HZC7KEO-Fjc?t=46), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT6fh77XeX8), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z70l3OUy9N4)]. Over the Summer and Fall of 2016, I spent time working on bleeding edge semiconductor chip manufacturing technology at [Cymer/ASML](https://www.cymer.com/).<br><br> Outside of research, I mentor undergraduate students on their journey toward postgraduate study through the [STARS](https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/programs/stars/index.html) and [UC LEADS](https://www.ucop.edu/graduate-studies/initiatives-outreach/uc-leads.html) programs. In the past I have also worked with the [IDEA Scholars](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/scholars.shtml) program and with high school outreach through the CRG.<br><br>This is the new address of my [previous site](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~jrorosco/)."
